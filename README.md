# Splash
**Splash** is a fluid simulation with the following features.
- Smoother fluid surface thanks to **Narrow-Range Filter (i3D 2018)** by Truong et al.
- **Shadows using ray marching** through the density field (particle mode only)
- Improved simulation performance due to the reduced number of substeps
- More interactionðŸŒŠ
